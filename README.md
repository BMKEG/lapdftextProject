lapdftextProject
================

High-level build project for all LAPDF-Text submodules.

*Note* - we have currently deprecated the development of the LA-PDFText rule web application that is not tied to the digital library. This means that we will no longer be developing the [lapdftextServer](https://github.com/BMKEG/lapdftextServer) web application separately of the [sciKnowMine](https://github.com/BMKEG/sciKnowMine) system. Interested developers and users are referred to the [sciKnowMineProject](https://github.com/BMKEG/sciKnowMineProject) for more information. 

To run this project, you should be able to compile this system directly from the download. This project is now *only* concerned with the [lapdftext](https://github.com/BMKEG/lapdftext) library, which is the base level
library containing all functionality for directly interacting with PDF files through the 
use of the JPedal GPL open source library (Beta level of development).
